# Scrabble
A program to take two user inputs, and output which users wins using letter scores from the game Scrabble.

### Criterion
+ Implement a program in C that determines the winner of a short Scrabble-like game. Your program should prompt for input twice: once for “Player 1” to input their word and once for “Player 2” to input their word. Then, depending on which player scores the most points, your program should either print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!” (in the event the two players score equal points).
+ Should work regardless of case.
+ Should only accept alphabetic characters.

### Additional info

This program uses a cs50.h header file, available [here](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/).
